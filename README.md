About the README: this file is an introduction to the project. Here I lay out the project folder organization. 

The purpose of this project was to visualize the hurricane wind trajectories from 1980-2010 using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). By taking the raw data from NOAA, I cleaned and reformated the data, then analyzed that data through several tables and maps. The project directory consists of 6 subdirectories, a skeleton script, and this readme file.


### Subdirectory Organization
1. Code- contains all the scripts and functions. You will find 3 files: 'storm.R', 'tracks.R', and 'data_analysis.R'. The storm script only analyzes the HEADER data; the tracks script analyzes the HEADER and DAILY DATA. 
2. Data- stores the cleaned and processed data files. These are the files that are used in the data analysis and to make plots. This file contains 2 csv's: 'storm.csv' and 'tracks.csv'
3. Images- contains all of the plots and graphs. This file contains 30 images, where each image is created twice in a png and pdf format.
4. Rawdata- used to store the original data files. This should contain 3 files: 'data.hdat', 'east_ pacific', and 'north_atlantic'
5. Report- contains the final report and knitted pdf made from the RMD file
6. Resources- contains documentation that was used to create this project
7. Skeleton- contains the commands to create the project subdirectories and the necessary files needed to start the project
